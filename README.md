# Enigma Cipher

The `Enigma Cipher` is a package that allows ciphering texts as an enigma machine would.
Further on, it is referred to 'cipher' the text instead of encoding/decoding.
This is because a machine can decode a text, which was encoded by another machine with the same configuration, by 're-encoding' it.



To do so, the package allows:
- Initialization with a specific configuration.
- Full random initialization.
-
